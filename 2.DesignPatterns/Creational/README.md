 ## Factory Method
Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

 ## Abstract Factory
Lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

- [Example here](https://github.com/alibaba-aero/QafConf/tree/main/2.DesignPatterns/Creational/Factory/AgileDeveloper-Abstract-Factory)

 ## Builder
Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

- Example here

 ## Prototype
Lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

- Example here

 ## Singleton
Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
